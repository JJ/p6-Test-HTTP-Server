=head1 NAME

Test::HTTP::Server - Simple to use wrapper around HTTP::Server::Async designed for tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::HTTP::Server;

  # Simple usage
  # $path is a folder with a selection of test files including index.html
  my $test-server = Test::HTTP::Server.new( :dir($path) );

  # method-to-test expects a web host and will make a GET request to host/index.html
  ok method-to-test( :host( "http://localhost:{$test-server.port}" ) ), "This is a test";
  # Other tests on the results here.

  my @events = $test-server.events;
  is @events.elems, 1, "One request made";
  is @events[0].path, '/index.html', "Expected path called";
  is @events[0].method, 'GET', "Expected method used";
  is @events[0].code, 200, "Expected response code";
  $test-server.clear-events;
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::HTTP::Server is a wrapper around HTTP::Server::Asnyc designed to allow for simple Mock testing of web services.
